Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The projects included here addressed creating embedded code for the Raspberry Pi 4 and integrating it with several components
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I parkored around having to buy the kit sold by the school and used the components I had on-hand and harvested from other devices. Prototyping feels best when it is also recycling :D
  
Where could you improve?
  I would like to do more low-level code. Python is great, but it's hard to ship things safely to production with it
  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  VSCode and several of the libraries used in this course
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  The ability to phyiscally interact with things using code
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Adding comments and photos of the breadboards for documenting where things were in case a wire popped out
